# hello-world

I majored in chemical engineering and minored in computer science. Knowledge of programming was extremely useful in the many researh projects that I have done. I first applied it in chemical engineering to solve systems of nonlinear equations for mass and energy balances. I then applied it to write scripts to process laboratory data and create data visualizations. I programmed microcontrollers that operated laboratory equipment and gathered data. I programmed user interfaces that vizualized equipment data streams in real time. I programmed an algorithm and packaged it in a user interface that was used by other researchers for their data analysis needs. My Master's project involved a lot of programming to process and extract information from the large amount of data that I had to process. I wrote scipts that renamed and organized the data files from the laboratory equipment. I did exploratory data analysis to investigate for trends. I programmed image analysis codes to extract information from the images. For example, to quantify the length of an electric arc from images I built an path finding code that uses Dijkstra's algorithm.

My goal is to use this experience in data processing and analysis to start a career in data science!

On my public GitHub you will find some of these projects that I want to share with world. I mostly used MATLAB because I had access to it through the university, but now I am transitioning to Python!
